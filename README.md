# BasicLighting

A 2D lighting system using GLUT & C/C++.

This fork is an attempt to port Jacob Brunson's original Java sources into a GLUT C/C++ version. Since original author deserves all the credit, i preferred to modify from Java sources, rather than starting from scratch.

You may find a simple dev blog on [here](abekkine.github.io/BasicLighting).
