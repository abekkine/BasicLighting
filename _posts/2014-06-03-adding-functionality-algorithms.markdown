It's time to implement some functionality. I begin with;

 * Shadow calculations from light sources,
 * Randomization functions for positions & colors,
 * Vector utilities needed in calculations.

Each of these will reside in an independent changeset. At the same time, i try to keep everything clean and readable.

In future posts you may find,

 * More about build environment and compiling,
 * Memory leak detection, profiling, and optimization where it is possible,
 * Porting to Windows and Mac, as well as Linux,
 * Porting to Python and Javascript, as well as C/C++.
