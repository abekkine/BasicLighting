After last commit into BasicLighting, we have a compiling and running application. It is almost sad that practically it does nothing :). However we have an easy to read application frame at our hands. 

Most of my time, after committing that changeset, spent to figure out how to maintain a project dev blog with jekyll. Now i believe i got it over, let's continue with development again.

We will continue with arranging structure, before filling it with functionality. Basically, we will

 * Separate additional classes into separate source files,
 * Create a dummy display class for visualization,

on following changesets.
